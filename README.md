# Fatality


This addon is made for World of Warcraft 3.3.5a

This is a modified version of the original Fatality, I've added the following features:

* Anti-spam feature (users of this addon will negociate between themselves and only one addon will send the messages)
* Anti-mute feature (queue messages to prevent mute, config this in the LUA file if it's not preventing mute on your server)
* Temp reassignment if the player become unable to speak, for example, when a Warlock who is in charge of speaking but he transforms into Demon Form (metamorphosis).
* Option to be turned on or off individually in raids and/or dungeons

Configs are done in lua file.
